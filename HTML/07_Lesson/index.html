                <p>An electric stove, electric cooker or electric range is a stove with an integrated electrical heating
                    device to cook and bake. Electric stoves became popular as replacements for solid-fuel stoves which
                    required more labor to operate and maintain. Some modern stoves come in a unit with built-in
                    extractor
                    hoods</p>

                <h2>Convection ovens</h2>
                <p>Convection ovens cook food a bit differently. There's a fan at the back that forces air circulation
                    throughout the oven, cooking food more evenly.</p>
                <p>Convection ovens are the type you find in any residential household. They can be gas or electric and
                    are not very complicated machines. The heat source at the bottom of the oven cabinet cooks food by
                    circulating hot air inside the oven cabinet. This hot air circulation is a natural process, called
                    convection and it can be assisted by internal oven fans. This is the difference between static and
                    fan-forced convection ovens.</p>

                        title="Pic of conventional ovens" width="500" height="500" loading="lazy"></figure>
                <p>Convection ovens are suited for roasting, some baking so can do many dishes from chicken to bread,
                    even some pies and pasties. Convection ovens come in many shapes and sizes to suit your kitchen’s
                    layout. Some are wider, some are deeper, some have GN compatible sized trays and some have bakery or
                    patisserie sized trays for different applications.</p>

                <h2>Combi Ovens</h2>
                <p>Combi Ovens cook food with steam. Like convection ovens, they are available in many different shapes
                    and sizes, usually referred to by the number of trays they have such as “a 5 tray oven” or “a 10
                    tray combi”. The advantages of cooking with steam are that it is very precise and very easy to use.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Combi steam ovens can also cook meat, fish and vegetables all at the same time. This is a handy
                    feature on some of the higher end models with many features. Different temperature steam can be
                    applied to different level trays so foods that require different temperatures can be cooked
                    simultaneously. The more feature-packed models have touch screen displays and with minimal training,
                    you can have a kitchen-hand cooking chef-level cuisine in no time.</p>

                <h2>Microwave Ovens</h2>
                <p>Microwave Ovens may not immediately come to mind when thinking of commercial ovens however they are
                    one of the most underrated and heavily utilized appliances in the modern commercial kitchen.</p>
                <p>Commercial Microwave ovens are similar to the one you have at home except that they are a lot more
                    powerful and usually somewhat larger too. Microwave ovens use a magnetron to generate and blast food
                    with microwaves which cause atoms and molecules to jump around ecstatically. This rapid movement on
                    a molecular and atomic level results in heat, thereby warming up your food!</p>
                <figure><img src="./images/microwave-ovens-Front-view-Thumb-450.avif" alt="Microwave ovens"
                        title="pic of micro-wave ovens" width="500" height="500"></figure>
                <p>Commercial microwave ovens are supplied in two main sizes/strengths, around 1100w and 1800w. Your
                    household microwave might be around 800 - 900w, so even a small commercial unit will be at least 25%
                    more powerful than a residential version. Microwave ovens are particularly handy when it comes to
                    frozen foods as the excited water molecules heat quickly enough to go from solid ice to gaseous
                    steam very quickly and the steam actually cooks the food, resulting in crunchy, fresh-tasting
                    delicacies!

                </figure>
                <p>Conventional ovens, also called traditional, regular, thermal or radiant ovens, have heating elements
                    that are typically located at the bottom and top of the oven. These models are known as the
                    traditional style of electric ovens and offer familiar settings and functions. In a conventional
                    oven, the dish closest to an active heating element cooks the fastest. In contrast, a convection
                    oven fan circulates air throughout the cavity and around dishes.</p>

            <h1>Kinds Of Webcams</h1>
            <section>
                <h2>Professional webcams</h2>
                <p>Professional webcams are IP-cameras and network webcams used for video surveillance of the site and
                    monitoring its indoor premises. Digital devices can record videos, digitize, crunch data and
                    transmit video over the network.</p>
                <figure><img src="./images/professional_webcams.webp" alt="Professional"

                        <figcaption>Professional webcam</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                <p>The difference between the IP-camera and casual device is that the former one has its own IP-address.
                    That is, the network webcam can function as a Web server with a direct connection to the Internet (
                    without using a computer). That’s why, if you have the Internet connection, you can control the
                    camera through the browser by means of receiving video and audio signals. Typically, there is a
                    remote connection to it via Wi-Fi.</p>
                <p>PTZ-controlled cameras are more updated devices. Such webcams are IP-cameras with the option of
                    adjusting the angle of rotation and slope. The resulting image is scaled easily and quickly,
                    besides, by setting a specific algorithm you can monitor a vast territory using only one camera.
                    These devices are equipped with coders into digital format and hard disc drives that store the shot
                    video.</p>

                <div>The main purpose of easy-to-use and relatively cheap amateur webcams is as follows:

                    <ul>
                        <li>video communication</li>
                        <li>taking photos</li>
                        <li>video recording</li>
                    </ul>

                    Such devices should be chosen according to the operation conditions.
